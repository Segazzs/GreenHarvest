# GreenHarvest

GreenHarvest is a one-page web project based on a ready-made design layout. The site represents an organic vegetable delivery service and focuses on visual presentation, content structure, and interface adaptability. The project is implemented using pure HTML and CSS. JavaScript is used exclusively for the mobile modal window. The layout is done with strict adherence to the design layout, including typography, color scheme, grid, and adaptation to different screen sizes. Special attention is paid to semantic HTML markup and clean, structured CSS implementation.

JavaScript functionality is limited to opening and closing the mobile modal menu. There are no other scripts in the project.

Technologies used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (minimal, only for the mobile modal window).

The project is intended to demonstrate front-end layout and static web interface.
